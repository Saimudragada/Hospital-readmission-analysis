HOSPITAL READMISSION RISK PREDICTION - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project analyzes CMS hospital readmission data to predict which hospitals
are at high risk for excessive readmissions and identify actionable interventions
to reduce penalties and improve patient care quality.

BUSINESS PROBLEM:
- CMS penalizes hospitals with readmission rates above expected levels
- Average hospital loses $500K-$1M annually in penalties
- Each preventable readmission costs $15,000-$20,000
- Poor readmission rates damage hospital quality ratings

DATA SOURCES:
1. CMS Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (FY 2025)
2. CMS Hospital General Information
3. Total: 8,121 hospital-condition records after cleaning

KEY FINDINGS:

1. SCALE OF PROBLEM:
   - 81.8% of hospitals have higher-than-expected readmission rates
   - $5.96 BILLION total financial impact at risk
   - 390,416 readmissions tracked across 6 medical conditions

2. HOSPITAL CHARACTERISTICS MATTER:
   - 1-star hospitals: 79.1% high-risk rate
   - 5-star hospitals: 32.7% high-risk rate
   - Clear correlation: better ratings = lower readmissions

3. GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS:
   - Massachusetts has highest rates (1.055 ratio, 73.6% high-risk)
   - Top states: MA, NJ, MS, NV, IL, WV, FL, NY, KY, CA

4. ALL CONDITIONS AFFECTED:
   - Heart Attack (AMI), Heart Surgery (CABG), Heart Failure (HF)
   - Hip/Knee Replacement, Pneumonia (PN), COPD
   - All show similar average readmission patterns

PREDICTIVE MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Test Accuracy: 100%
- ROC-AUC Score: 1.000
- Perfect classification of high vs low risk hospitals

TOP PREDICTIVE FEATURES:
1. Readmission Gap (Predicted - Expected Rate)
2. Expected Readmission Rate
3. Predicted Readmission Rate
4. Number of Discharges
5. Hospital Star Rating

FINANCIAL IMPACT OF INTERVENTIONS:
- 10% readmission reduction → $586M savings
- 25% readmission reduction → $1.46B savings
- Helping 100 hospitals avoid penalties → $5M savings

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. RISK STRATIFICATION
   Implement predictive model to identify high-risk hospitals in real-time
   for targeted intervention programs

2. FOCUS ON LOW-RATED HOSPITALS
   1-2 star hospitals should be priority for quality improvement initiatives
   (79% vs 33% high-risk rate compared to 5-star hospitals)

3. GEOGRAPHIC TARGETING
   Allocate resources to MA, NJ, MS, and other high-risk states

4. COMPREHENSIVE CARE PROTOCOLS
   Develop post-discharge care programs across all 6 tracked conditions

5. PROACTIVE DISCHARGE PLANNING
   Use model to score individual patient readmission risk before discharge

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES:
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression)
- Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Statistical Analysis

BUSINESS VALUE:
This analysis demonstrates ability to:
✓ Work with real government healthcare data
✓ Frame business problems with clear ROI
✓ Build accurate predictive models
✓ Communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders
✓ Provide actionable recommendations with financial impact
